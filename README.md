# Phase-4-Code-Challenge-VendorSweets-062223
Phase 4 Flask Code Challenge: Candy Store APIOverviewThis project is a Flask-based RESTful API for managing a candy store's inventory, vendors, and their associated sweets with pricing. The API allows users to retrieve lists of sweets and vendors, view vendor details with their sweets, create associations between vendors and sweets with a price, and delete such associations. The application uses Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate, Flask-RESTful, and SQLAlchemy-Serializer to handle database operations, migrations, routing, and JSON serialization.The project meets the requirements of the Phase 4 Code Challenge, focusing on:Models, Relationships, and Validations: Correctly defined models with a many-to-many relationship and validations.
Routes and REST: RESTful routes with appropriate HTTP methods and naming conventions.
Response Structure: Structured JSON responses with nested data and correct HTTP status codes.

Git (for version control)

Setup InstructionsClone the Repository:Download the code challenge ZIP file from Canvas and unzip it into your working directory.
For WSL users:Open Ubuntu and run explorer.exe . to open the current directory in Windows File Explorer.
Copy the unzipped folder to your WSL Linux file system (e.g., /home/<your-username>/projects).

Navigate to the unzipped directory:bash

cd code-challenge
ls  # Should show bin/ and code-challenge.bundle

Initialize the Project:Run the start script with your name:bash

./bin/start.py <your-name>

If permission denied, run:bash

chmod +x ./bin/start.py
./bin/start.py <your-name>

This creates a code-challenge/ directory.

Navigate to the project directory:bash

cd code-challenge

Set Up the Environment:Install dependencies:bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Required packages include flask, flask-sqlalchemy, flask-migrate, flask-restful, and sqlalchemy-serializer.

Initialize the database with Flask-Migrate:bash

flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration with Sweet, Vendor, VendorSweet models"
flask db upgrade

Run the Application:Start the Flask development server:bash

python app.py

The API will be available at http://localhost:5555.

Database ModelsThe application uses three models to represent the candy store domain, defined in models.py.SweetRepresents a type of candy or sweet.Fields:id: Integer, primary key.
name: String, required, unique (e.g., "Chocolate Bar").

Relationships:Many-to-many with Vendor via VendorSweet.
vendor_sweets: Relationship to VendorSweet records.
vendors: Association proxy to access associated vendors.

Validations:name must be non-empty (raises ValueError if empty).

VendorRepresents a vendor that sells sweets.Fields:id: Integer, primary key.
name: String, required, unique (e.g., "Candy Shop").

Relationships:Many-to-many with Sweet via VendorSweet.
vendor_sweets: Relationship to VendorSweet records.
sweets: Association proxy to access associated sweets.

Validations:name must be non-empty (raises ValueError if empty).

VendorSweetRepresents the association between a vendor and a sweet, including the price.Fields:id: Integer, primary key.
price: Integer, required, non-negative (e.g., 100 for $1.00).
sweet_id: Integer, foreign key to Sweet.id.
vendor_id: Integer, foreign key to Vendor.id.

Relationships:sweet: Relationship to the associated Sweet.
vendor: Relationship to the associated Vendor.

Validations:price must be a non-negative integer (raises ValueError if invalid).

RelationshipsMany-to-Many: Vendor and Sweet are linked through VendorSweet. A vendor can sell multiple sweets, and a sweet can be sold by multiple vendors.
Cascading Deletes: Deleting a Sweet or Vendor deletes associated VendorSweet records (cascade='all, delete-orphan').
Association Proxy: Vendor.sweets and Sweet.vendors provide convenient access to related records.

ValidationsSweet.name: Must be non-empty and unique.
Vendor.name: Must be non-empty and unique.
VendorSweet.price: Must be a non-negative integer.
Error messages are descriptive (e.g., "Price must be a non-negative integer") to meet rubric requirements.
